# ThermoPAL-AS-Rebuild
 Replaced the main board of a ThermoPAL Autosampler with Arduino. This git includes the code for the Arduino based on grbl, a GUI app to control the AS from PC, and a plugin for YLClarity CDS to interface with the AS. The machine is capable of automated sample preparation and running injection sequences with fraction collection using YLClarity CDS.
